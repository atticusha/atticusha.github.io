# What is this?

This is a collection of bilingual corpora for Plains Cree (nêhiywawêwin) and English.


# What can these be used for?

Probably a lot, but paralell corpora are really useful for nmt testing. There is not all that much available, so it may not be as useful in training. It is probably best used for testing, but I am a readme not an authority figure, so you do you.


# What is the copyright situation here?

I own nothing. Nothing hosted here is created, transcribed, or verified by myself. 


# I think something is spelled wrong...

If there is an issue, you can let me know my sending an email to atticus.harrigan@ualberta.ca, but as I am not a native or fluent speaker, I won't be editing other authors's work here.
